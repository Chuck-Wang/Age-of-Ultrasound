> **Overview of Ultrasound Capturing Solution Design Goals**

The design challenge presented is to create a device that will improve
the quality of photos of ultrasounds taken by a mobile phone. In
conjunction with this challenge, the device needs to be durable,
affordable, easy to use, easily storable, lightweight, readable, and
easy to learn how to use. The primary objective of the challenge is to
produce a clearer image (due to the importance of clarity in this
project, image clarity is defined as a constraint \[Table1\]). Further,
the image produced by the design needs to be easily read by specialists.
The design will be implemented in low-resource regions so durability (in
regards to system not being easily damaged) and affordability (in
regards to cost bounds dictated by low resource clinics) are important.
The device being developed should be easy to use and learn for the
individuals who will be operating it. Any device made would likely make
the process of taking a photo of the ultrasound longer, so being easy to
use and learn are crucial to the solution being implemented in clinics.

> **Rationale for Criteria and Constraints**

The primary constraint is to improve ultrasound image quality, so the
percentage of ultrasound image that is clear was a constraint since it
ranked higher than all other criteria in the pairwise comparison chart
(Table 3). The other constraints mentioned came from our client, who
told us that any device being used in a medical setting needs to be
easily sanitized and be free of magnetic materials. Readability is our
highest ranking criteria as the image produced by the solution needs to
be able to be understood by radiologists so that they can diagnose
patient conditions. Ease of use is one of our two most important design
criteria because if the device is not easily usable, individuals can opt
to just use the current solution (taking a photo with a mobile phone) to
take a photo quickly. Affordability was tied with ease of use because if
the device is expensive, clinics and health workers in developing
regions would not be able to justify the price, as the current solution
does not cost any money beyond owning a smartphone. Looking at the cost
per use, if we assume the device will be used 4500 times over 3 years
(our client stated that it would likely be used 4-5 times per day), even
at a market cost of $50, the cost per use is 1 cent. This cost per use
is justifiable for even low resource areas. Easy to learn was our lowest
ranking criteria because the initial learning curve does not matter as
much as the time needed to set up each time and the cost of the
solution, which individually could inhibit the solution from being
implemented.

**Criteria**

  - > **Easy to learn: \>4 on user defined scale;** Since we cannot
    > quantify how easy it is to learn something, a user defined scale
    > was used to make sure our design is not so difficult to use that
    > it discourages people from using it. Four was the target score on
    > our User Defined Scale because as long as the operation of our
    > device can be learned through the instructions, the solution will
    > most likely be used by clinics.. If more than one person is needed
    > to learn how to use the solution, it would likely be set aside for
    > the current method. The user defined scale we created is in Table
    > 2, contains our metric for easy to learn, defined by the quantity
    > of instructions and individuals needed.
    
      - > Easy to learn received a 0 because although it was important
        > for the design to be able to be operated easily, it was less
        > important than the amount of time the solution needed to be
        > set up each time.

  - > **Readability: At least 100 of the 256 shades of grey are present
    > in the photo.** Due to the variance in camera quality and
    > megapixel count, we decided to quantify the readability on the
    > value of grayscale. Ultrasounds differentiate tissue, muscle,
    > bone, and fluids, by shades of grey, black and white. Grayscale is
    > defined on 256 different shades so 100 was a reasonable value for
    > the 8-bit grayscale because of the kinds of phones and variance in
    > quality we will be dealing with. We will speak to a radiologist at
    > a later date to check this criteria and see if the value is
    > reasonable for being able to discern important aspects of an
    > ultrasound image.
    
      - > Readability was the highest ranking criteria because the
        > primary objective for this project is to make the ultrasound
        > images taken result in more accurate diagnosis from the
        > specialists analyzing them. If the image produced does not
        > contain at least 100 of these 256 values on the grayscale, it
        > would make it more difficult for a radiologist to find the key
        > traits or features they are looking for to be able to diagnose
        > a patient, which is why we assigned it a 4 on our pairwise
        > chart.

  - > **Ease of use: setup time \< 2 minutes;** The design needs to be
    > out of the way of the ultrasound machine for the most part but
    > when in use, it should take under two minutes to set up. Two
    > minutes was defined as our criteria for setup time because the
    > time to take a photo with your phone would be around this value
    > due to setup and if multiple shots were taken. If the time needed
    > to setup the device was significantly greater than the time needed
    > to implement the current solution, the design would not be used.
    
      - > Easy to use was tied for the second highest ranking criteria.
        > It received 2.5 because if it was not within the time needed
        > to take a photo normally, the individuals using the design
        > would likely choose not to use the solution. Since if this
        > criteria was not met, the solution would likely not be used,
        > it beat everything other than affordability and readability.

  - > **Durability: Lasts up to a maximum 5 foot Drop:** The client made
    > it clear that the product should not be able to be easily broken,
    > and can be used even after an accident. By assessing 5 drops at 5
    > ft (higher than approximate ultrasound height), it can inferred
    > how well constructed the device is.
    
      - > Durable received a 1 compared to our other criteria because
        > the cost per use of the solution and the ease of use have a
        > larger impact on the implementation of the solution. The
        > solution needs to be able to withstand drops and numerous uses
        > as the ultrasound machines can be either stationary or
        > portable, which increases the risk of damage to the solution.

  - > **Manufacturing Cost \< $50:** Since this design is targeted for
    > low-resource areas, if the cost is greater than $50, the purchase
    > will be hard to justify as the current market solution costs $0.
    > In addition, the client expressed that a high price point would
    > lead to the product not being recognized by small clinics and
    > hospitals.
    
      - > Affordability was tied for the second highest criteria ranking
        > at a 2.5. Affordability is so important because the areas that
        > this solution will be applied in are low-resource regions so
        > the cost needs to be affordable to clinics or any kind of
        > health stations that provide ultrasounds. $50 was chosen as
        > the highest value because since the item needs to be durable,
        > at this max price the cost per use over 3 years is around 1
        > cent per use, which is easily affordable.

  - > **Constraints**
    
      - > **Improving the image:** The primary goal of this design is to
        > improve the image of the ultrasound photos taken. Since we
        > cannot quantify the exact pixels per inch or the quality of
        > the image, we decided to base it on whether it makes the image
        > include more of the ultrasound. We defined the improvement as
        > having greater than 85% of the photo being of the ultrasound
        > screen. This is given that the device also reduces artifacting
        > in the photo which obstructs specialists from being able to
        > read the ultrasound properly.
    
      - > **Able to be sanitized:** Due to the sanitization requirement
        > in hospitals, the device should be easily cleaned with
        > alcohol. So the design should not contain any porous material
        > or cloth.
    
      - > **No magnetic components:** Since magnetic material can
        > interfere with the display of the ultrasound machine, the
        > design should be free of any magnetic components.
