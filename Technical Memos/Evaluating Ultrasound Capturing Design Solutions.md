**SUBJECT: Evaluating Ultrasound Capturing Design Solutions**

**Rationale for Weighting Design Criteria and Constraints**

The criteria and constraints we started with at the beginning of the
screening process were

readability, durability, ease of use, affordability, and easy to learn.
Our constraints were percent of the image that is the ultrasound screen,
cleanable, and no magnetic components. To weigh our criteria we looked
at the Pairwise Comparison Chart we created earlier and also how
important each criteria was for the success of the solutions present.
Initially we divided the score weighing importance up as 0.15 to
durability, 0.20 to ease of use, 0.05 to easy to learn, 0.20 to
affordable, and 0.4 to readability. Readability had the most weight as
it was crucial that the solution permitted the largest possible variety
of grayscale so that the ultrasound image could be read. Ease of use and
affordability had half the value of readability and were weighted the
same because the affordability of the solution was important so that it
could reach all clinics in low resource areas but just as important was
its implementation. The cost and time needed to use the solution were
equally important to the solution being successful. Durability was
weighted 0.15 as it was important but not as important as affordability
since the cost is a limiting factor for clinics. Easy to learn was
weighted the least as the learning curve for the solution does not
matter as much as the rest of the criteria. However when doing our first
scoring set we realized that since our components were made of 2 sets of
ideas, stabilizing and anti-glare, readability on its own would not be
enough to asses the last solutions. To mitigate this issue we decided to
split readability into two components solely for the purpose of the pugh
scoring sets. Readability became 0.2 which assessed variety of grayscale
present and anti-glare which became 0.2 to assess how well the solution
reduces artifacting and glare.

**Ultrasound Capturing Design Solutions for Pugh Screening**

  - **Flipped Frame and Overlaying Protectors:** This solution is a
    mechanism for setting up the photo as well as reducing the glare.
    The flipped frame is made of 2 parts shaped like L’s that fold out
    from the top of the screen where the bottom of the L is a hook to
    position the mobile phone. The overlaying protector is multiple
    screen filters that adjust for glare by having a matte finish with a
    colored filter on top of the matte protector.

  - **Mechanical Hinges with Overlaying Protectors:** This solution
    includes a overlaying removable screen protector and a mechanism
    with multiple hinges that allows for adjusting both position and
    angle of the camera phone relative to the screen. The design of the
    mechanical hinges would resemble the structure of a adjustable
    monitor stand.

  - **Flipped Frame with Screen Protector:** This solution includes a
    permanent screen protector for the ultrasound screen and a flipped
    frame. The flipped frame is made of 2 parts shaped like L’s that
    fold out from the top of the screen where the bottom of the L is a
    hook to position the mobile phone.

  - **Pyramid with Clip on Frame and Lens:** This solution includes a
    pyramid shaped clip-on frame in pyramid shape that can block
    excessive light and a polarized lens that can be attached to phone
    camera.

  - **Mirror with Flexible Legs:** This solution includes a mirror that
    will be attached to the side of ultrasound machine with a set of
    hinges and flexible stands to stabilize the camera phone. With this
    design, user will take picture of ultrasound images from the glass
    to minimize glaring.

**Method of Selecting Solution**

To get to the pugh scoring matrix as shown in table 1, we began by
screening our ideas by decision block. Initially we had stabilizing
solutions, anti-glare solutions, software solutions, and methodologies.
After meeting with our client, we were able to eliminate software
solutions as it was mentioned that flip phones might be needed to be
used in these situations. Then we realized methodologies could not be
assessed by these criteria and can be added to instructions to any given
solution, which eliminated the second block. We then screened
stabilizing and anti-glare solutions to find the best ideas of each
section.

**\*FF=Flipped Frame**

After our final pugh scoring, flipped screen and screen protector
solution received the highest score. This solution is selected as the
final solution because flipped screen is a efficient way of stabilizing
photo camera and screen protector is a cost-effective way to avoid
glare. Since both flipped frame and screen protector are elements of
other existing accessories, they are the most intuitive to use and
learn. Also, because of the fact that all the components are
mass-produced, they are easily accessible at a cheap price. Its metal
characteristic provides great durability. So, even though it is not the
best choice in improving image quality, its advantage in ease of learn
and use, and durability makes it our most fitting solution.

**Appendix**

**Justification for Durability**

When designing our apparatus for taking photos of an ultrasound machine
screen, durability is of great importance. This is because this design
will be used multiple times (about 4-5) in a single day in order to take
photos of the ultrasounds that need further evaluation. If the design
breaks/malfunctions in a way, there will not be an effective and
accurate way of transferring ultrasounds to other’s who specialize in
reading ultrasounds. In addition, the apparatus must be able to last a
long time before needing a new one in order to save on cost and
accessibility. Table 2 illustrates the scale that will be used in order
to access the durability of our design.

**Table 2. Durability Scoring
Scale**

|           |                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Score** | **Value**                                                          |
| 5         | Survive a drop greater than 7 feet                                 |
| 4         | Survives a drop from between 5 feet and 7 feet                     |
| 3         | Survives a drop from between 3 feet and 5 feet                     |
| 2         | Survives a drop from between 1 feet and 3 feet                     |
| 1         | Survives a drop from less than 1 feet or does not survive any drop |

In the scale that is demonstrated in Table 2, surviving a test drop from
between 3 feet to 5 feet was given the standard score of three. This is
because, the average ultrasound machine height is between 3.5 feet and 5
feet This would mean that our design should be able to withstand a drop
from this height and still be fully functional. Therefore, if our design
survives a drop above 5 feet, it will get a higher score. For example,
if the apparatus survives a drop between 5 feet and 7 feet, it will get
a score of 4 on the durability test and if it survives a drop from
greater than 7 feet then it will get a score of 5. On the other hand, if
the design does not survive (is not functional) after a drop between 3
feet and 5 feet, then it will get a score lower than 3. If the design
solution only survives a drop between 1 feet and 3 feet, then it will
get a score of 2. If the design survives a drop test from less than 1
feet or does not survive any drop at all, then it will get a 1.

In terms of our proposed solutions,

**Mechanical Hinges with Overlaying Protectors - 3**

A mechanical hinge with an overlaying protector was determined to be
the standard and was given a score a 3. This is because the rotational
part of the apparatus will be made out of cheap plastic that can
survive a drop test from 3 feet to 5 feet but would break if dropped
from a height of greater than 5 feet

**Mirror with Flexible Legs - 1**

A mirror with flexible legs scored a 1. This is because the mirror is
made of glass and will likely shatter if dropped from 1 feet in the
air.

**Pyramid and Clip on Frame Screen - 2**

The pyramid shaped clip-on frame and lens scored a 2 because the lens
will likely survive a drop from 1 feet, however will not be functional
if dropped between 2 feet and 3feet

**Flipped Frame and Overlaying Protectors - 4 & Flipped Frame with
Screen Protector - 4**

Both a flipped frame with an overlaying protector and a flipped frame
with a screen protector scored a 4. This is because the hinges of a
flipped frame will be made of metal. This would mean that it would
survive a drop test from any height. However, the delicate material of
a overlaying/screen protector has potential of breaking if dropped
from a height between 5 feet and 7 feet For this reason, the overall
score for both apparatuses was given a 4.

**Justification for Ease of Use**

In order to determine the ease of use of our product, we needed to
compare to the simplest (current) model of the design. The current
design is simply the user using their phone to photograph images and
then send them through WhatsApp. Based on testing, it was discovered
that it takes approximately 1 minute to 1 minute and 15 seconds to
capture an image and send it. By utilizing the best case scenario, we
developed our scale as follows in Table 3.

**Table 3: Ease of Use Scoring Scale**

|           |                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Score** | **Value**                     |
| 5         | Takes \<1 minute to use       |
| 4         | Takes 1 to 1.5 minutes to use |
| 3         | Takes 1.5 to 2 minutes to use |
| 2         | Takes 2 to 2.5 minutes to use |
| 1         | Takes \>2.5 minutes to use    |

**Flipped Frame and Overlaying Protectors - 3**

The flipped frame and overlaying protector was given a score of 3.
Because the flipped frame works in a single movement coming from the
top of the ultrasound machine, and the overlaying protector consists
of multiple layers that need to be adjusted the maximum setup time was
dictated to be approximately 30-45 seconds, giving us the range
dictated in category 3.

**Mechanical Hinges with Overlaying Protectors - 3**

The mechanical hinges and overlaying protector was given a score of 3.
It works in a very similar fashion to the flipped frame and overlaying
protector by simply instead having a hinge that comes from the side of
the ultrasound machine. Because the hinge works in a single movement
coming from the top of the ultrasound machine, and the overlaying
protector consists of multiple layers that need to be adjusted the
maximum setup time was dictated to be approximately 30-45 seconds,
giving us the range dictated in category 3.

**Flipped Frame with Screen Protector - 4**

The flipped frame and screen protector was given a score of 3. The
flipped frame works in a single motion as expressed above, however
instead of the overlaying protector the screen protector needs no
adjustment. Therefore maximum setup time was dictated to be
approximately 15 seconds, giving us the range dictated in category 4.

**Pyramid and Clip on Frame Screen - 2**

The pyramid and clip on frame screen was given a score of 2. The
pyramid design of the system calls for an extension movement, and the
clip design requires user defined movement to capture the image. These
two movements are more complex than the flipped frame and mechanical
hinges therefore it was dictated that maximum setup time be at least a
minute, giving us the range in category 2.

**Mirror with Flexible Legs - 1**

The Mirror with Flexible Legs was given a score of 1. Because the
flexible leg design and the mirror angle adjustment need to be set up
by the user, and the mirror angle adjustment that needs to be user
setup, the design was dictated to take at least 1 minute to 1.5
minutes to set up, giving us a range in category 1.

**Justification for Affordability Scores**

During our conversation with Dr. Richardson, we clarified that, since
our design will mainly be used in low resource areas, the manufacturing
cost of should be lower than 50$, with an ideal cost around 15$.
Therefore, score 3 in the scoring scale for Pugh scoring is set to be
10-15$

Then we set increment to be 5$ for each score and the resulting scoring
standard is shown in Table 4.

**Table 4: Affordable Scoring Scale**

|           |                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Score** | **Value**                          |
| 5         | Manufacturing cost lower than 5$   |
| 4         | Manufacturing cost from 5$ - 10$   |
| 3         | Manufacturing cost from 10$ - 15$  |
| 2         | Manufacturing cost from 15$ - 20$  |
| 1         | Manufacturing cost higher than 20$ |

Based on research on manufacturing materials, at custompartnet.com, a
manufacturing cost calculation platform, we can estimate the production
cost of our design solution.

**Flipped Frame and Overlaying Protectors - 5**

The design solution with a flipped frame and overlaying protector
receive a score of 5 because the manufacturing cost for flipped frame
and screen protector are lower than 2$ respectively.

**Mechanical Hinges with Overlaying Protectors - 5**

Design solution with mechanical hinges and overlaying protectors also
receive a score of 5 since mechanical hinges can be manufactured for
lower than 3$ per piece.

**Flipped Frame with Screen Protector - 3**

The combined design of flipped screen and screen protector received a
score of 3 because a screen protector with adhesive that is required
in this design costs around 10$ to manufacture.

**Pyramid and Clip on Frame Screen - 2**

The pyramid shaped clip-on frame with a lens received a score of 2
because, while the pyramid-shaped frame cost around 10$ to
manufacture, incised polarized lens costs around 5$ - 10$.

**Mirror with Flexible Legs - 4**

The solution with a Mirror with Flexible Legs received a score of 4
because it can be manufactured for a total cost of around 8$. Because
mirror and flexible legs each take about 4$ to manufacture.

**Justification for Readability Values**

To assess the readability of our solutions, our criteria was a certain
number of values on a grayscale. Since ultrasounds are black and white
images, it was very important that the solutions kept the greatest
number of different shades in order to make the ultrasound image
produced as readable as possible for the specialists. The 8-bit
grayscale is a numbered system from 0-256 so we assessed our solutions
on their theoretical placement based on properties and individual
mechanisms used in each solution. 5 is a solution that has greater than
78% of the grayscale present, 4 is 58% to 77%, 3 is 39% to 57%, 2 is 19%
to 38% and 1 is 0% to 18%. Based on whether filters or items directly
impacting glare or coloration of the screen were used compared to purely
stabilizing mechanisms, solutions were given an estimated value that
could be tested using software made to test contrast.

**Table 5: Readability Grayscale Scoring Scale**

|                        |                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Readability Scale ** | **Value on the 8-bit Grayscale from 0-256** |
| 5                      | 200-256                                     |
| 4                      | 150-200                                     |
| 3                      | 100-150                                     |
| 2                      | 50-100                                      |
| 1                      | 0-50                                        |

**Flipped Frame with Overlaying Screen Protector - 2**

Overlaying protectors reduces the variance in colors presented so the
grayscale value would be between 50-100. This depends on how dark the
filter selected is.

**Mechanical Hinges with Overlaying Protector - 2**

The overlaying protector with mechanical hinges would reduce glare but
faces a similar problem as the screen protector with flip on frame and
polarizing lens. The overlaying protector contains not only a
anti-glare sheet but also sheets to adjust color darkness. Using a
darker filter with a anti-glare filter would decrease the number of
whites present and change what the ultrasound would read.

**Screen Protector with Flip on Frame and Polarizing Lens - 3**

The screen protector with flip on frame and polarizing lens received a
3 on the scale, containing 100 to 150 of the 256 possible gray values
due to the screen protector being added. Although the screen protector
would reduce glare on glossy CRT screens, it can also adjust the
colors presented on the screen at certain angles.

**Light adjusting Pyramid with clip on frame - 4**

With a pyramid using a clip on frame, the readability would be from
150-200 due to the pyramid blocking excess light. This puts the load
of ensuring the color is accurate on the camera and since there is a
large variance of cameras being used, could darken the image too much
or over brighten it by reducing light through the pyramid and then
brightening it through software.

**Mirror with flexible legs - 5**

5 is defined as containing 200 to 256 of the 256 possible shades on
the grayscale. This value is subject to the quality of the screen that
the ultrasound is produced on but because we are reflecting the image
and taking the photo from that image, the color adjustment should be
0. Since there is nothing filtering the output from the original
screen, the photo produced by this solution would contain most of the
grayscale.

**Justification for Anti-Glare Values**

For the purpose of pugh scoring we broke our readability criteria into
two criterias to properly assess the solutions. Anti-glare was
determined by percentage of the screen that is glare free because half
of design ideas were made up of anti-glare mechanisms. If the image was
95% free of glare it was a 5 and it goes down in 5% increments from
there. We chose to have a 15% variance from the highest to lowest
ratings because all of our solutions in our pugh scoring matrix included
a method to handle glare and artifacting, but we needed to separate them
based on how well they could mitigate common artifacting issues.

**Table 6: Anti-Glare Scoring
Scale**

|                      |                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anti-Glare Scale** | **Value as a percentage of the ultrasound image that is free of glare** |
| 5                    | More than 95%                                                           |
| 4                    | From 90% to 95%                                                         |
| 3                    | From 85% to 90%                                                         |
| 2                    | From 80% to 85%                                                         |
| 1                    | Less than 80%                                                           |

**Flipped Frame with Overlaying Screen Protector - 2**

The flipped frame with overlaying protector received a 2 on the scale
for anti-glare because although it incorporates the overlaying screen
protectors, the number of filters that need to be used increase the
number of points where light can diffuse and refract increasing the
possibility for glare.

**Mechanical Hinges with Overlaying Protector - 2**

The mechanical hinges with overlaying protector received the same
score for the same reasons as the flipped frame. Since a overlaying
protector introduces many more points where light can diffract, the
reduction of glare would be minimal.

**Screen Protector with Flip on Frame and Polarizing Lens - 4**

This solution received a 4 for anti-glare because it not only has a
polarizing lens on the mobile device that is taking the photo but a
matte screen protector to reduce glare. With 2 methods of glare
removal most of the image will be glare-free.

**Light adjusting Pyramid with clip on frame - 4**

The pyramid with a clip on frame received a 4 because since the
pyramid can adjust the light entering the frame of the photo, the
light being projected onto the screen can be controlled to minimize
glare.

**Mirror with Flexible Legs - 5**

The mirror method received the highest score because since it is
easiest to just move the mirror to an angle/position that has no
glare, it should reduce glare by a significant amount for most photos
taken.

**Justification for Easy to Learn Scores**

We have defined our design objective “Easy to Learn” using a User
Defined Scale, and hope to achieve a target value of \>4 on that scale.
The scoring scale for pugh scale was, therefore, based on our
understanding of how much each solution will score, around an average of
the given value of 4, on the User Defined Scale. Table 7 lists the
scoring scale for the pugh scoring matrix that we utilised.

**Table 7: Easy to Learn Scoring Scale**

|           |                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Score** | **Value**                                |
| 5         | Scores an average of \>4.8 on UDS        |
| 4         | Scores an average from 4.4 to 4.8 on UDS |
| 3         | Scores an average from 4.0 to 4.4 on UDS |
| 2         | Scores an average from 3.6 to 4.0 on UDS |
| 1         | Scores an average of \<3.6 on UDS        |

We next identified some foundations on which to score our solutions on.
The key component of our scoring logic included that the greater the
number of components or scientific complexity, the lesser the chance
that the user will feel that the product is easy to learn.

**Flipped Frame with Overlaying Screen Protector - 2**

The flipped frame with overlaying protector received a 5 because it
has the maximum technical simplicity and minimum number of components.

**Mechanical Hinges with Overlaying Protector - 4**

The mechanical hinges with overlaying protector received a 4 because
although it has a greater number of components , but it also is
extremely simple to learn.

**Screen Protector with Flip on Frame and Polarizing Lens - 5**

It has a similar technical simplicity and similar number of
components.

**Light adjusting Pyramid with clip on frame - 3**

We believe that a pyramid with a clip on frame will require more
adjustments every time it is set up and needs more instructions to
optimise picture quality, hence it receives a score of 3.

**Mirror with flexible legs - 3**

The mirror method also requires significant adjustments which far
outweigh its simplicity, and it also receives a score of 3.

We therefore determined the Flipped Frame+Screen based solutions have
maximum overall technical simplicity, followed by the Mechanical
Hinges based design solution, followed by Pyramid and Mirror based
solutions.
