**SUBJECT: Brainstorming for Ultrasound Capturing Device Solutions**

**Overview of Brainstorming Process**

In order to find ideas for our design challenge, we took the main
areas that we researched about phone cameras and thought of possible
solutions. Since we are improving the quality of the image, anything
that potentially reduced glare, made the phone more stable, changed
exposure, limited noise or artifacting in the photo was considered. We
used the Writing Slip method to brainstorm ideas within our team and
hitch-hiked off of each otherâ€™s ideas. The brainstorming process took
about 2.5 hours for our team to complete. Also we looked at potential
complete design solutions instead of individual components of a
solution.

**Light Control and Anti Glare Solutions**

  - Change the angle between camera and screen

  - A film for the ultrasound screen that decreases the amount of
    glare

  - Dark or polarized lens for camera

  - A frame, with adequate lighting, mounted on ultrasound machine to
    provide equal lighting on the screen (Figure 1)

  - Capture image from reflection of a mirror or glass which is
    attached to the ultrasound machine (resembles the anti-glare
    display solution in museums) (Figure 2)

  - Cell phone case that has lights around to provide adequate
    lighting

  - A box/frame that blocks light from the outside environment

  - A box/frame with an adjustable slit that can control the amount of
    light that come through the top/sides

  - Different configurations of the box to change the amount of light
    coming through

  - Creating a specific area within the room with adequate amount of
    lighting that optimises picture quality

  - Overlaying different matte screen protectors with light filters on
    top of the screen to mitigate CRT issues

  - Using a pyramid shape with clips for the phone and screen to
    prevent excess items from appearing in the photo

**Phone Stabilizing Attachments**

  - Hanging mechanism using hinges attached to ultrasound
    machine(Figure 3)

  - Frame that uses a clip to stabilize camera phone (Figure 4)

  - Frame that can be flipped over ultrasound machine when not in use
    (Figure 5)

  - An movable, adjustable mechanical design for attaching camera and
    using it to focus on ultrasound screen (Figure 6)

  - Frame design with splicing joints (Figure 7)

  - Frame design with only two stand fixed to the bottom of the screen
    (Figure 8)

  - Screen capturing solution with phone directly mounted on the top
    of ultrasound screen (Figure 9)

  - Frame with flexible stands from four corners of the screen (Figure
    10)

  - Frame design with spring system (resembles the spring system in
    umbrellas)

  - Cell phone case resembling the one worn on belt

  - Gimbel on top of a rotating arm that folds behind the screen to
    allow for lateral and vertical movement of the camera

**Manual/Peripheral Devices for Capturing Better Quality Images**

  - Adjusting screen brightness

  - Tilting screen away from light sources

  - Written instructions for user on how to take better photos

  - Tripod/quadripod stand to stabilize the phone

  - Gimbal to allow the phone to be moved around by the operator but
    also stabilize the photo

**Direct Transmission of Pictures from Machine to Phone**

  - Wireless server attached to ultrasound machine

  - Digital transfer unit, splicing the output of the ultrasound
    machine to a laptop

  - Webcam that relays images back directly to a phone, or a video
    stream

  - Scanner placed on the ultrasound screen

  - A dental X ray machine-like design which uses a mobile phone
    attached to it to capture image

  - A specialised ultrasound camera to relay images to a phone

**App Based Enhancement**

  - GIF Creator application for android device motion capture

  - Android application to solely detect light of the ultrasound
    machine and excludes other light sources

  - Application for clicking a long exposure photograph such as those
    used to take city photos

  - An application which combines rapidly taken images to form a short
    video

  - Phone software that might enhance image quality and improve
    contrast, like the application CamScanner

  - Combining and overlaying multiple photos on top each other and
    combining the best elements to form a single or multiple images

  - Using filter settings on the normal android camera app

  - Application that reads and records numbers from the ultrasound,
    and send the data that conveys the full picture in numbers only

  - Changing ISO and aperture settings on the camera app to control
    amount of light that enters the camera

  - App that crops and refocuses the best parts of the ultrasound
    image
