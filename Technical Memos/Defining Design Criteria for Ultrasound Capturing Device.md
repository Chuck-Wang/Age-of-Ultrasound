**SUBJECT: Defining Design Criteria for Ultrasound Capturing Device**

**Overview of Ultrasound Capturing Solution Design Goals**

The design challenge presented is to create a device that will improve
the quality of photos of ultrasounds taken by a mobile phone. In
conjunction with this challenge, the device needs to be durable,
affordable, easy to use, easily storable, lightweight, readable, and
easy to learn how to use. The primary objective of the challenge is to
produce a clearer image (due to the importance of clarity in this
project, image clarity is defined as a constraint \[Table1\]). Further,
the image produced by the design needs to be easily read by specialists.
The design will be implemented in low-resource regions so durability (in
regards to system not being easily damaged) and affordability (in
regards to cost bounds dictated by low resource clinics) are important.
The device being developed should be easy to use and learn for the
individuals who will be operating it. Any device made would likely make
the process of taking a photo of the ultrasound longer, so being easy to
use and learn are crucial to the solution being implemented in clinics.

**Rationale for Criteria and Constraints**

The primary constraint is to improve ultrasound image quality, so the
percentage of ultrasound image that is clear was a constraint since it
ranked higher than all other criteria in the pairwise comparison chart
(Table 3). The other constraints mentioned came from our client, who
told us that any device being used in a medical setting needs to be
easily sanitized and be free of magnetic materials. Readability is our
highest ranking criteria as the image produced by the solution needs to
be able to be understood by radiologists so that they can diagnose
patient conditions. Ease of use is one of our two most important design
criteria because if the device is not easily usable, individuals can opt
to just use the current solution (taking a photo with a mobile phone) to
take a photo quickly. Affordability was tied with ease of use because if
the device is expensive, clinics and health workers in developing
regions would not be able to justify the price, as the current solution
does not cost any money beyond owning a smartphone. Looking at the cost
per use, if we assume the device will be used 4500 times over 3 years
(our client stated that it would likely be used 4-5 times per day), even
at a market cost of $50, the cost per use is 1 cent. This cost per use
is justifiable for even low resource areas. Easy to learn was our lowest
ranking criteria because the initial learning curve does not matter as
much as the time needed to set up each time and the cost of the
solution, which individually could inhibit the solution from being
implemented.

**Criteria**

  - **Easy to learn: \>4 on user defined scale;** Since we cannot
    quantify how easy it is to learn something, a user defined scale
    was used to make sure our design is not so difficult to use that
    it discourages people from using it. Four was the target score on
    our User Defined Scale because as long as the operation of our
    device can be learned through the instructions, the solution will
    most likely be used by clinics.. If more than one person is needed
    to learn how to use the solution, it would likely be set aside for
    the current method. The user defined scale we created is in Table
    2, contains our metric for easy to learn, defined by the quantity
    of instructions and individuals needed.
    
      - Easy to learn received a 0 because although it was important
        for the design to be able to be operated easily, it was less
        important than the amount of time the solution needed to be
        set up each time.

  - **Readability: At least 100 of the 256 shades of grey are present
    in the photo.** Due to the variance in camera quality and
    megapixel count, we decided to quantify the readability on the
    value of grayscale. Ultrasounds differentiate tissue, muscle,
    bone, and fluids, by shades of grey, black and white. Grayscale is
    defined on 256 different shades so 100 was a reasonable value for
    the 8-bit grayscale because of the kinds of phones and variance in
    quality we will be dealing with. We will speak to a radiologist at
    a later date to check this criteria and see if the value is
    reasonable for being able to discern important aspects of an
    ultrasound image.
    
      - Readability was the highest ranking criteria because the
        primary objective for this project is to make the ultrasound
        images taken result in more accurate diagnosis from the
        specialists analyzing them. If the image produced does not
        contain at least 100 of these 256 values on the grayscale, it
        would make it more difficult for a radiologist to find the key
        traits or features they are looking for to be able to diagnose
        a patient, which is why we assigned it a 4 on our pairwise
        chart.

  - **Ease of use: setup time \< 2 minutes;** The design needs to be
    out of the way of the ultrasound machine for the most part but
    when in use, it should take under two minutes to set up. Two
    minutes was defined as our criteria for setup time because the
    time to take a photo with your phone would be around this value
    due to setup and if multiple shots were taken. If the time needed
    to setup the device was significantly greater than the time needed
    to implement the current solution, the design would not be used.
    
      - Easy to use was tied for the second highest ranking criteria.
        It received 2.5 because if it was not within the time needed
        to take a photo normally, the individuals using the design
        would likely choose not to use the solution. Since if this
        criteria was not met, the solution would likely not be used,
        it beat everything other than affordability and readability.

  - **Durability: Lasts up to a maximum 5 foot Drop:** The client made
    it clear that the product should not be able to be easily broken,
    and can be used even after an accident. By assessing 5 drops at 5
    ft (higher than approximate ultrasound height), it can inferred
    how well constructed the device is.
    
      - Durable received a 1 compared to our other criteria because
        the cost per use of the solution and the ease of use have a
        larger impact on the implementation of the solution. The
        solution needs to be able to withstand drops and numerous uses
        as the ultrasound machines can be either stationary or
        portable, which increases the risk of damage to the solution.

  - **Manufacturing Cost \< $50:** Since this design is targeted for
    low-resource areas, if the cost is greater than $50, the purchase
    will be hard to justify as the current market solution costs $0.
    In addition, the client expressed that a high price point would
    lead to the product not being recognized by small clinics and
    hospitals.
    
      - Affordability was tied for the second highest criteria ranking
        at a 2.5. Affordability is so important because the areas that
        this solution will be applied in are low-resource regions so
        the cost needs to be affordable to clinics or any kind of
        health stations that provide ultrasounds. $50 was chosen as
        the highest value because since the item needs to be durable,
        at this max price the cost per use over 3 years is around 1
        cent per use, which is easily affordable.

  - **Constraints**
    
      - **Improving the image:** The primary goal of this design is to
        improve the image of the ultrasound photos taken. Since we
        cannot quantify the exact pixels per inch or the quality of
        the image, we decided to base it on whether it makes the image
        include more of the ultrasound. We defined the improvement as
        having greater than 85% of the photo being of the ultrasound
        screen. This is given that the device also reduces artifacting
        in the photo which obstructs specialists from being able to
        read the ultrasound properly.
    
      - **Able to be sanitized:** Due to the sanitization requirement
        in hospitals, the device should be easily cleaned with
        alcohol. So the design should not contain any porous material
        or cloth.
    
      - **No magnetic components:** Since magnetic material can
        interfere with the display of the ultrasound machine, the
        design should be free of any magnetic components.
